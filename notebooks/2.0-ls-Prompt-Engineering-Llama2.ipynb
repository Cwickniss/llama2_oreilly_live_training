    "So far we've discussed a bit about the basics of prompting models and some prompt engineering techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what's special about prompting Llama2? I think there are a few worthy mentions regarding that if you're running the model directly or through llama-cpp:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a special prompt template is specific to llama2 chat models and differs from the base models, which have no prompt structure and are raw, non-instruct tuned models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The template formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For newlines escaped (e.g., using with curl or terminal):\n",
    "\n",
    "```<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\\n{system_message}\\n<</SYS>>\\n\\n{user_message_1} [/INST]\n",
    "With regular newlines (e.g., for text-generation-webui):\n",
    "<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\\n{system_message}\\n<</SYS>>\\n\\n{user_message_1} [/INST]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<s>[INST] {user_message_1} [/INST]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continuing a Conversation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Append model responses for ongoing conversations using similar templates, with model replies included.\n",
    "\n",
    "- End of String Signifier:\n",

    "- Single Message End of String Signifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It is not clear whether an end of string signifier is used for single messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Default System Message:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The default system message emphasizes the assistant being helpful, respectful, honest, safe, and socially unbiased. It advises against harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content.\n",

    "A prompt is a piece of text that conveys to a LLM what the user wants. What the user wants can be many things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Asking a question\n",
    "- Giving an instruction\n",
    "- Etc...\n",

    "The key components of a prompt are:\n",

    "2. Context: additional information to help with performance\n",
    "3. Input data: data the model has not seem to illustrate what you need\n",
    "4. Output indicator: How you prime the model to output what you want, for example asking the model [\"Let's think step by step\" and the end of a prompt can boost reasoning performance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903.pdf). You can also write \"Output:\" to prime the model to just write the output and nothing else.\n",
