The entire training cycle is super efficient, which takes 8 hours on one\\n8xA800 (80G) GPU machine. The resulted model exhibits superior performances\\nacross a broad range of evaluation tasks, such as NIHS, topic retrieval, and long-\\ncontext language understanding; meanwhile, it also well preserves the original\\ncapability over short contexts. The dramatic context extension is mainly attributed\\nto merely 3.5K synthetic training samples generated by GPT-4 , which indicates\\nthe LLMs’ inherent (yet largely underestimated) potential to extend its original\\ncontext length. In fact, the context length could be extended far beyond 80K\\nwith more computation resources. Therefore, the team will publicly release the\\nentire resources (including data, model, data generation pipeline, training code) so\\nas to facilitate the future research from the community: https://github.com/\\nFlagOpen/FlagEmbedding .\\n1 Introduction\\nRecently, considerable attention has been directed towards long-context large language models,\\nwhere different approaches are adopted to establish long-context capabilities for large language\\nmodels [ 4,14,5,8,9,16,2]. However, most of them require significant compute and resources to\\naccomplish.\\nIn this technical report, we propose an efficient solution for entitling the long-context capabilities for\\nLLMs, with which we extend the context length of Llama-3-8B-Instruct3from 8K to 80K. Specifically,\\nwe use GPT-4 [13] to synthesize 3.5K long-context training data, covering three long-context tasks:\\n1.Single-Detail QA : the inquiry targets on one specific detail in a long context. To construct\\ndata for this task, we slice out a short segment (e.g., a chunk with less than 4096 tokens)\\nfrom a long context (e.g., a book or a long paper) and prompt GPT-4 to generate multiple\\nquestion-answer pairs based on this segment.\\n2.Multi-Detail QA : the inquiry requires information aggregation and reasoning over multiple\\ndetails in a long context. We define two types of long context. The homogeneous\\ncontext contains a coherent text, such as a book or a long paper. We prompt GPT-4 to\\ngenerate multiple question-answer pairs that require aggregating and analyzing information\\nfrom different locations in the context. The heterogeneous context consists of multiple\\nindependent texts. Notably, we perform clustering over a large corpus then extract texts from\\n∗Corresponding author.\\n2The model is noted as Llama-3-8B-Instruct-80K-QLoRA given its max context length during fine-tuning.\\nHowever, users could apply the model for even longer contexts via extrapolation.\\n3https://llama.meta.com/llama3/\\nPreprint.
