Abstract
We extend the context length of Llama-3-8B-Instruct from 8K to 80K via QLoRA
fine-tuning2 . The entire training cycle is super efficient, which takes 8 hours on one
8xA800 (80G) GPU machine. The resulted model exhibits superior performances
across a broad range of evaluation tasks, such as NIHS, topic retrieval, and longcontext language understanding; meanwhile, it also well preserves the original
capability over short contexts. The dramatic context extension is mainly attributed
to merely 3.5K synthetic training samples generated by GPT-4 , which indicates
the LLMs’ inherent (yet largely underestimated) potential to extend its original
context length. In fact, the context length could be extended far beyond 80K
with more computation resources. Therefore, the team will publicly release the
entire resources (including data, model, data generation pipeline, training code) so
as to facilitate the future research from the community: https://github.com/

Introduction

Recently, considerable attention has been directed towards long-context large language models,
where different approaches are adopted to establish long-context capabilities for large language
models [4, 14, 5, 8, 9, 16, 2]. However, most of them require significant compute and resources to
accomplish.
In this technical report, we propose an efficient solution for entitling the long-context capabilities for
LLMs, with which we extend the context length of Llama-3-8B-Instruct3 from 8K to 80K. Specifically,
we use GPT-4 [13] to synthesize 3.5K long-context training data, covering three long-context tasks:
1. Single-Detail QA: the inquiry targets on one specific detail in a long context. To construct
data for this task, we slice out a short segment (e.g., a chunk with less than 4096 tokens)
from a long context (e.g., a book or a long paper) and prompt GPT-4 to generate multiple
question-answer pairs based on this segment.
2. Multi-Detail QA: the inquiry requires information aggregation and reasoning over multiple
details in a long context. We define two types of long context. The homogeneous
context contains a coherent text, such as a book or a long paper. We prompt GPT-4 to
generate multiple question-answer pairs that require aggregating and analyzing information
from different locations in the context. The heterogeneous context consists of multiple
independent texts. Notably, we perform clustering over a large corpus then extract texts from

The model is noted as Llama-3-8B-Instruct-80K-QLoRA given its max context length during fine-tuning.
However, users could apply the model for even longer contexts via extrapolation.

the same cluster to form each heterogeneous context. Therefore, the grouped texts share
some semantic similarity. We then prompt GPT-4 to ask about the similarities/dissimilarities
across these texts.
3. Biography Summarization: we prompt GPT-4 to write a biography for each main character
in a given book.
For all three tasks, the length of context is between 64K to 80K. Note that longer data can also be
synthesized following the same methodology. When training, we organize the question-answer pairs
for the same context in one multi-turn conversation then fine-tune the LLM to correctly answer the
questions given the entire long context as input. Following previous work4 , we mix 5K instances
randomly chosen from RedPajama [6] to mitigate forgetting. We also mix LongAlpaca [5] in the
training set, which contains 12K instruction tuning instances with 16K length at maximum. Therefore,
the entire training dataset contains 20K instances.
We use QLoRA [7] to efficiently fine-tune the model. We apply LoRA on all Q,K,V,O projections
and additionally train the embedding layer. We set LoRA rank to 32 and alpha to 16. The learning
rate is 5e-5 with linear decay and no warmups. The batch size is 8. Gradient checkpointing is enabled.
No parallel strategy is required thanks to the efficient implementation from Unsloth [1]. We train the
model for 1 epoch, which takes 8 hours to complete on a 8xA800 (80G) machine. Importantly, we
expand the RoPE base from 500K to 200M in training.
Our contributions are highlighted as follows:
• We release Llama-3-8B-Instruct-80K-QLoRA, which extends the context length of Llama3-8B-Instruct from 8K to 80K. The entire resources including the model, training data, and
code are all publicly available, which may advance the field of training long-context LLMs.
• Our training recipe is simple and efficient, while the resulted model demonstrates remarkable performance on downstream long-context tasks. Further research can be made to
improve our approach.

Firstly, we leverage the Needle-In-A-Haystack task, which aims to recall an irrelevant piece of
information (a.k.a. needle) inserted into a lengthy context (a.k.a. haystack). The accuracy is evaluated
with GPT3.5. We use the same needle and haystack as in the official repository6 . Our model achieves
100% accuracy over all its training context length. Besides, the model generalizes well to the unseen
positions (80K∼128K).
Secondly, we report the Topic Retrieval [12] accuracy in Figure 2. This task synthesizes a long
conversation with multiple independent discussions of a certain topic between the user and the
assistant. Then the LLM is required to repeat the first topic as is in the conversation. We use the
conversations made up of [5,10,15,20,25,30,40,50,60,70] topics for evaluation. It can be observed
that Llama-3-8B-Instruct fails to remember the topic when the context is longer than 9K. However,
the accuracy of our model remains 100% throughout all context lengths.

Thirdly, we evaluate our model on LongBench [3], which contains a variety of real-world long-context
tasks. Most context on this benchmark is shorter than 32K. Thus, we use 32K context length by
default and 8K for Llama-3-8B-Instruct. The results are shown in Table 1. Our model significantly
and consistently outperforms all baselines except on the code completion task. Mixing more code
data in training may mitigate this problem.
Forthly, we employ the English Long-Book QA and the Long-Book Summarization task from
InfiniteBench [17] to assess the model’s performance on really long context. The testing instances are
usually longer than 100K. We truncate them to 80K. According to Table 2, Llama-3-8B-Instruct-80KQLoRA excels on answering the questions based on the long context. It also achieves competitive
performance against GPT-4 in terms of summarization. Interestingly, Llama-3-8B-Instruct with
8K context outperforms GPT-4 with 128K context on summarization. This is likely to be a metricoriented issue (currently rouge-f1 is used) since the summary may have different paraphrases, which
may not necessarily overlap with the ground truth.
Lastly, in Table 3, we compare the zero-shot performance of our model and the baselines on
MMLU [10] benchmark. We also include Llama-2-7B-Chat [15] and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 [11]
for comparison. It can be observed that both long-context models underperform the original Llama-38B-Instruct, indicating that context extension may compromise the model’s short-context capability.
This observation is in line with previous research [14]. However, our model’s performance is still
superior to other open-source models at the same scale.
